This project is a playground UI for Large Language Modals (LLMs). It utilizes:
- [LangChain.js](https://github.com/langchain-ai/langchainjs) for model call abstraction and Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)
- [React](https://github.com/facebook/react) and [Next.js](https://github.com/vercel/next.js) for UI and server

## Prerequisites

To run this project you need
- [Node.jsÂ®](https://nodejs.org/en/download/package-manager) v20+
- [pnpm](https://pnpm.io/installation) 9+
- [Ollama](https://ollama.com/download)

## Run locally

This playground currently only supports a locally running Ollama server with llama3.1. To start the model run:

```bash
ollama run llama3.1
```

To start the application in development mode run:

```bash
pnpm install
pnpm dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) in your browser to see the result.

## Configuring the Playground

The playground can be customized via environment variables, with default settings defined in the [`.env`](.env) file.
To configure the playground for a local development environment, simply copy the contents of `.env` to a new file named
`.env.local`, and update the values as needed. This file is excluded from version control.
